# merge-tickets
I grab data from two customer files and a employee file.
With that I assign employees of certain ranks to the dedicated customer (within each respected file) 
and assign it to them for them to serve that customer.
Made logs file to make sure that certain information is tracked (possibly for trainning or HR reasons).
